The equation describing the RCL is the following one:
RCL = {âˆ€tT | c.getCost() â‰¤ qMin + (qMax âˆ’ qMin) Â· Î±)}
where:
â€¢ c are the candidates
â€¢ c.getCost() returns the cost of a candidate
â€¢ qMin is the value of the minimum cost among the candidates
â€¢ qMax is the value of the maximum cost among the candidates
â€¢ Î± is the value that represents the greediness of the algorithm. At iteration 0 it has value 1, for a pure
random solution. Next iteration, alpha gets 0.7, to allow some greediness. At iteration 25 with no
change, alpha takes value 0.3, coming close to the total greediness
