In this algorithm, given a solution W, the method findBetterSolution tries to find a better solution than the
current one. If the new solutionâ€™s cost is the same as the cost of the previous solution, it decided that it has
reached a local optimum and stops searching. If not, it keeps looking for a better solution.
